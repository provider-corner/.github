This corner of GitHub collects providers for OpenSSL 3.0 and beyond.
Some of the providers have repositories here, other are simply linked to below

## Providers elsewhere

[BLAKE3 provider (blake3-prov)](https://github.com/J-Montgomery/blake3-prov) by 
[Jordan M.](https://github.com/J-Montgomery)

[Open Quantum Safe provider (oqs-provider)](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) by [Open Quantum Safe](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe).
This is their [liboqs integration in earlier OpenSSL versions](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl), taking the form of a provider for OpenSSL 3.

[TPM 2.0 provider (tpm2-openssl)](https://github.com/tpm2-software/tpm2-openssl) by [Petr Gotthard](https://github.com/gotthardp) and the [tpm2-software community](https://tpm2-software.github.io/).

[PKCS#11 provider](https://github.com/latchset/pkcs11-provider) by [\@latchset](https://latchset.github.io/)

[MD5 provider](https://github.com/docularxu/md5_mb_provider/tree/working_ossl_3.0_provider) by [Guodong Xu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/docularxu) from [Linaro.org](https://www.linaro.org/). This provider supports an MD5 algorithm implementation. It is based on the [multi-threaded version of ISA-L_crypto](https://github.com/docularxu/isa-l_crypto/tree/working_md5_multi_threads) which allows to harness multiple CPU cores to further increase the bandwidth. The original [ISA-L_cypto](https://github.com/intel/isa-l_crypto) provides a basic multi-buffer MD5 implementation.

[(Windows only) CNG provider](https://github.com/Lipovlan/cng-openssl-provider) by [\@Lipovlan](https://github.com/Lipovlan)

[Quantis Provider](https://github.com/cchinchole/SSLRngProviders/) by [\@cchinchole](https://github.com/cchinchole)
